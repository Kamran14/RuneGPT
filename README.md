🧠 RuneGPT

Ask Gemini about Old School RuneScape (OSRS) using your current player stats and bank items!

🚀 Features
- 🛡️ Context-Aware: Queries include your stats and optional bank items for tailored suggestions.
- 🖥️ Easy-to-Use Panel: Ask questions directly from RuneLite’s sidebar.

🛠️ Setup
1. Install the Plugin:
    - Add the plugin via the RuneLite Plugin Hub.
    - Enable RuneGPT from the RuneLite settings.

2. Enter Your API Key (BYOK – Bring Your Own Key):

You must bring your own API key for Gemini (Google). This plugin does not provide one.

Why?

- 💳 API keys are tied to your OpenAI/Google account.
- 🚫 We do not store or share your key. It stays local on your machine.

🔑 How to Add Your API Key:
- Go to Google [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), click `Get API Key` and copy the key you just created
- In RuneLite, go to Configuration (wrench icon).
- Find RuneGPT Plugin under settings.
- Enter your Google Gemini API Key.

✨ Usage

- Open the RuneGPT Panel from the sidebar.
- Enter a question like:
    - "What’s the best setup for Barrows with my stats?"
    - "Can I solo Zulrah with my current gear?"

🛡️ Security

- Your API key is stored locally via RuneLite’s secure configuration.
- No keys or data are sent anywhere except directly to the LLM provider.

💸 Costs

This plugin uses Google Gemini API, which currently offers free API access with generous usage limits. Check Google's terms for any updates on usage policies.

Note: OpenAI and others require you to add a payment method whereas Google does not. Main factor in picking the service.
